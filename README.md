Chris’s BlogForum v1.0

This is my blog/forum I built for myself to give me a platform to journal my journey of learning programming. There is social functionality built into it as well in the form of a like/dislike button system, tagging sysem, and the ability for logged in users to comment as well as post their own posts.

To use, hit signup and fill out the sign up form. *NOTE* password must be min 8 characters and contain lowercase, uppercase, number, and at least one special character for security. To login, hit login in the navbar and enter username and password then hit login. You will be redirected to the homepage upon successful login and your username will replace the login button.

Make a post by clicking “Make a New Post”. Keep in mind when entering tags, they must be comma separated, and they ARE CASE SENSITIVE. You may also upload anything with the following extensions: ("png", "jpg", "jpeg", "gif", "tiff", "tif", "svg", "mp4", "avi", "avchd", "mov", "flv", "wmv", "mp3", "m4a", "wav", "pdf", "txt", "html", "xls", "xlsx", "doc", "docs")  and also URL’s for redirection.

There is a search bar in the navbar that will search through posts using entered keywords and display the posts on a page. The tagging system works similarly. For the tags, click on a tag and it will pull up a page listing all posts with said tag. Within the list of posts, the title of the post is a clickable link that will take you to the post itself.

In the navbar, click on your username to bring you to your user account page where you can fill out a little bio of yourself and add a profile pic if you want. You will also see a list of all your comments and posts.

Built from scratch with html, css, Python, SQL, some AI for code snippets, and hours and hours and hours of effort. No templates used.
